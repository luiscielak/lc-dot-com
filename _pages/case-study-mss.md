<!-- # Case Study: Technician Dispatch Platform -->

<!-- ## 🚀 Hook -->

## TL;DR

Led the redesign of a mobile-first dispatch platform that transformed paper-based workflows into a real-time digital system. Achieved 95% mobile adoption in 30 days and reduced dispatch-to-completion time by 40%.

### Overview

A nationwide logistics company was coordinating over 100,000 specialized moves annually using outdated methods—paper schedules, Excel sheets, and PDF forms. Technicians in the field lacked a cohesive digital tool, leading to inefficiencies and miscommunication across teams.

I led the UX design of a mobile-first dispatch platform that modernized operations, offering real-time visibility and intuitive tools tailored for technicians and dispatchers alike.

### Problem

The dispatch process was fragmented and manual, causing frequent delays and errors:

- ❌ **Paperwork Overload:** Manual job tracking increased error rates.
- ❌ **No Real-Time Updates:** Dispatchers lacked visibility into field progress.
- ❌ **Poor Usability:** Tools weren’t optimized for mobile use in the field.

### Solution

We built a digital dispatch platform optimized for field use and HQ monitoring, with:

- Centralized job information and status tracking.
- Offline functionality and mobile-first design.
- Real-time job assignment, tracking, and rerouting.

<!-- ## ✍️ Journey -->

### Research & Insights

Methods:

- Shadowed dispatchers and rode along with technicians.
- 10+ contextual interviews.

Findings:

- **Spotty Connectivity:** Offline access was critical.
- **Simplicity First:** Field techs wanted less clutter, clearer visibility.
- **Visibility Gaps:** Dispatchers needed real-time insights.

> “I don’t need a ton of features—just my list of jobs and a quick way to mark them done.” — Field Technician 


> “We lose track of where each tech is at during the day. Once they’re out, we’re basically blind.” — Dispatcher

### Decision Decisions

_A look at the pivotal design decisions that shaped the experience, balancing real-world constraints with user needs._

Mapped full workflow: _Dispatch → Technician View → Progress → Completion Sync._

Key UX decisions:

- 📅 Simplified daily scheduling.
- 🗂️ Job cards with detailed instructions.
- 👆 One-tap status updates.
- 📈 Dispatcher dashboard for live monitoring.

Usability tests led to offline sync, larger tap targets, and UI refinements.

<!-- ## 🏁 Outcome -->

### Final Design

- Technician mobile interface for job tracking.
- Real-time dispatcher console.
- Modular design system for future scalability.

### Impact

- ⏱️ **95% Mobile Adoption** within 30 days.
- 📝 **Zero Paper Dispatching** within 6 weeks.
- ⏱️ **40% Faster Job Completion.**

## Reflection

Designing for real-world constraints like low connectivity and gloves-on usage was key. Next time, I’d prioritize deeper early-stage field testing.
