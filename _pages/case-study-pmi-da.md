# PMI Disciplined Agile Certification Toolkit

## Empowering Agile Learners: Redesigning PMI‚Äôs Certification Experience

---

### Overview

In 2022, PMI needed to evolve its Disciplined Agile (DA) certification experience to meet the needs of a growing global audience. With over 250,000 users engaging with PMI‚Äôs learning platforms, it became clear that fragmented pathways and outdated workflows were leading to user frustration and business inefficiencies.

I partnered closely with product managers, business analysts, and developers to lead user research synthesis, define the learner journey, and design a streamlined digital experience that better supported certification candidates from first interest to course completion.

---

### Problem

The existing Disciplined Agile certification process was fragmented, requiring learners to navigate multiple disconnected systems with little guidance.  
Common user pain points included:

- Difficulty understanding where to start or which path to follow
- High drop-off rates after initial onboarding
- Confusing access to training, exam registration, and credential management

Business-wise, these inefficiencies were leading to delayed certification timelines and poor learner satisfaction scores.

---

### Solution

We redesigned the end-to-end DA learning journey into a unified, user-centered digital experience.

Key solutions included:
- A guided learning flow tailored to the user‚Äôs selected path
- Clear visibility into course requirements, exam registration, and credential maintenance steps
- Consolidation of key resources into a single dashboard experience

---

## Uncovering Key Insights

To deeply understand the learner journey and its friction points, I collaborated with our research team to conduct 18 user interviews across three key segments:
- First-time PMI learners
- Returning members seeking recertification
- International learners navigating regional offerings

We also reviewed NPS feedback and analyzed platform usage data over six months.

#### What We Found:
- **Lack of Guidance:** 73% of new users expressed confusion about which certification path to pursue
- **Task Abandonment:** Data showed a 40% drop-off rate between starting and completing registration workflows
- **Fragmented Ecosystem:** Users cited frustration with being redirected across multiple platforms without a clear sense of progress
- **Trust Erosion:** International learners felt unsure whether they were choosing the "right" path for their needs

## Crafting the New Learning Experience

Building on the research insights, I led rapid ideation sessions with stakeholders to map out a more intuitive learner journey.

### Design Goals:
- **Guidance-first**: Help users understand the path from start to certification at a glance
- **Progress visibility**: Clearly indicate next steps and completion status at every stage
- **Simplification**: Minimize platform switching and reduce unnecessary steps

### Key Design Moves:
- **Unified Dashboard**: Designed a central hub where users could see their certification path, current progress, and immediate next actions
- **Step-by-Step Navigation**: Introduced a visual "journey map" that broke down the certification process into clear, actionable stages
- **Contextual Guidance**: Embedded tooltips, recommendations, and help links at critical decision points
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Prioritized mobile usability to better serve PMI‚Äôs global user base

---

### Iteration and Validation

We tested early prototypes with 12 users across three continents.

#### Key Iterations:
- **Simplified Language**: Replaced jargon with action-based copy (e.g., "Get Certified")
- **Full Journey View**: Users preferred to see the full certification path up front
- **Progress Indicator**: Added visual progress ("Step 2 of 4 Completed") for momentum and clarity

These changes helped reduce confusion and keep users engaged throughout their journey.

---

## Final Design

The redesigned experience delivered a streamlined, human-centered certification flow:
- Learners could immediately see their current status and what to do next
- Actions like course enrollment, exam registration, and credential claiming were consolidated
- Guidance and support were embedded directly into the experience

## Impact

### Business Outcomes:
- ‚è±Ô∏è 23% faster learner progression from enrollment to certification
- üìâ 18% reduction in support tickets for DA-related platform issues
- üìà +12-point increase in satisfaction scores for the certification journey

### User Outcomes:
- Clearer navigation of the DA path
- Improved confidence in selecting and completing certifications
- Greater trust in PMI‚Äôs digital experience

---

## Reflection

This project reinforced the importance of user education within complex systems.  
Clear visual guidance, paired with contextual support, was key to improving outcomes ‚Äî especially in a fragmented ecosystem.

If I were to do this again, I‚Äôd push for even earlier involvement from international learners to better localize the journey experience.
