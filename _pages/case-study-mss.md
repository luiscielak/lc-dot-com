# MSS Technician Dispatch Platform

## Modernizing Technician Dispatch: Digitizing MSS’s Logistics Operations

---

### Overview

Moving Specialty Services (MSS) is a nationwide logistics company coordinating over 100,000 specialized residential moves annually. Technicians were relying on outdated systems—pen and paper, Excel, and PDF schedules—to manage dispatches, parts, and client information.

I led the UX design of a new technician dispatch platform that streamlined day-to-day operations, enabled real-time updates, and replaced legacy workflows with a modern digital tool tailored to mobile-first field use.

---

### Problem

Technicians lacked a centralized digital system to manage dispatches and client tasks. Common challenges included:

- Manual paperwork led to frequent scheduling errors
- Limited visibility into job progress for HQ and dispatchers
- Inefficient routing and status reporting delayed service delivery

This lack of operational clarity affected both technician productivity and customer satisfaction.

---

### Solution

We built a web-based dispatching system that:
- Centralized job information, parts tracking, and status updates
- Enabled dispatchers to assign and update work orders in real time
- Allowed technicians to access schedules, log work, and complete jobs via mobile

---

## Discovery & Research

To define the problem space, I joined field observations, shadowed dispatchers, and ran contextual interviews with 10+ technicians and managers.

#### Key Insights:
- Technicians often worked in areas with spotty internet, needing robust offline support
- Dispatchers struggled to track technician status across hundreds of simultaneous jobs
- Most technicians preferred a simple, minimal UI optimized for mobile or tablet use

## Design & Prototyping

With these constraints in mind, I created low-fidelity wireframes to map the core job workflow:  
→ Dispatch assignment → Technician view → Job progress → Completion sync

We focused on:

- **Day-view scheduling**: An agenda-like calendar to reduce missed jobs
- **Job cards**: Containing all relevant instructions, tools needed, and notes
- **Smart status updates**: Allowing one-tap progress tracking for field workers
- **Dispatcher dashboard**: Offering real-time job monitoring and exception handling

I led multiple prototype review sessions with internal stakeholders and ran usability testing with 8 technicians using interactive mobile prototypes.

---

### Iteration Highlights

- Simplified calendar UI after confusion during early tests
- Replaced dropdowns with large tap targets for gloves-on field use
- Added offline save + sync fallback for unreliable connection zones

---

## Final Design

The final platform included:

- Technician mobile views with job-by-job tracking
- Real-time dispatch interface for admin staff
- Role-specific access and visibility

The design system was modular, enabling MSS to expand it to other business units in the future.

---

## Impact

- 📱 Mobile usage adoption reached **95%** within the first month
- 🚫 Paper-based dispatching dropped to nearly zero
- 🕒 Dispatchers reported faster re-routing and rescheduling
- 📉 Reduction in job-switching errors and friction

---

## Reflection

This project showed the importance of designing for real-world conditions — like low connectivity and physical labor constraints.  
Keeping the interface simple, offline-ready, and field-tested led to faster adoption and real operational improvements.
