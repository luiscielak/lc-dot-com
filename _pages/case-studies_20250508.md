# Case Study: Technician Dispatch Platform

## üöÄ Hook

### TL;DR

Led the redesign of a mobile-first dispatch platform that transformed paper-based workflows into a real-time digital system. Achieved 95% mobile adoption in 30 days and reduced dispatch-to-completion time by 40%.

### Overview

A nationwide logistics company was coordinating over 100,000 specialized moves annually using outdated methods‚Äîpaper schedules, Excel sheets, and PDF forms. Technicians in the field lacked a cohesive digital tool, leading to inefficiencies and miscommunication across teams.

I led the UX design of a mobile-first dispatch platform that modernized operations, offering real-time visibility and intuitive tools tailored for technicians and dispatchers alike.

### Problem

The dispatch process was fragmented and manual, causing frequent delays and errors:

- ‚ùå **Paperwork Overload:** Manual job tracking increased error rates.
- ‚ùå **No Real-Time Updates:** Dispatchers lacked visibility into field progress.
- ‚ùå **Poor Usability:** Tools weren‚Äôt optimized for mobile use in the field.

### Solution

We built a digital dispatch platform optimized for field use and HQ monitoring, with:

- Centralized job information and status tracking.
- Offline functionality and mobile-first design.
- Real-time job assignment, tracking, and rerouting.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Journey

### Research & Insights

Methods:

- Shadowed dispatchers and rode along with technicians.
- 10+ contextual interviews.

Findings:

- **Spotty Connectivity:** Offline access was critical.
- **Simplicity First:** Field techs wanted less clutter, clearer visibility.
- **Visibility Gaps:** Dispatchers needed real-time insights.

> ‚ÄúWe lose track of where each tech is at during the day. Once they‚Äôre out, we‚Äôre basically blind.‚Äù ‚Äî Dispatcher

# Case Study: Certification Experience Platform

## üöÄ Hook

### TL;DR

Led the redesign of a certification experience platform, transforming a fragmented process into a streamlined, mobile-first journey. Reduced learner drop-offs by 18% and accelerated certification timelines by 23%.

### Overview

A global certification body served over 250,000 learners but its digital experience was fragmented, leaving users frustrated and support teams overwhelmed. I led the UX overhaul to deliver a cohesive, guided certification journey.

### Problem

The process was disjointed and confusing:

- ‚ùå **No Clear Guidance:** Learners didn‚Äôt know where to start.
- ‚ùå **High Drop-Offs:** 40% of users abandoned midway.
- ‚ùå **Disconnected Systems:** Frustrating system switching.
- ‚ùå **Low Trust:** International learners were unsure of the right path.

### Solution

We redesigned the experience with:

- Unified certification pathways.
- Guided dashboards and visual progress tracking.
- Embedded contextual support.
- Fully mobile-responsive design.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Journey

### Research & Insights

Methods:

- 18 interviews with diverse learner segments.
- Data analysis + NPS reviews.

Findings:

- 73% confused about starting points.
- 40% drop-off during registration.
- Need for transparency and trust-building.
