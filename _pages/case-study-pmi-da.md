## TL;DR

Led the redesign of a certification experience platform, transforming a fragmented process into a streamlined, mobile-first journey. Reduced learner drop-offs by 18% and accelerated certification timelines by 23%.

### Overview

A global certification body served over 250,000 learners but its digital experience was fragmented, leaving users frustrated and support teams overwhelmed. I led the UX overhaul to deliver a cohesive, guided certification journey.

### Problem

The process was disjointed and confusing:

- ❌ **No Clear Guidance:** Learners didn’t know where to start.
- ❌ **High Drop-Offs:** 40% of users abandoned midway.
- ❌ **Disconnected Systems:** Frustrating system switching.
- ❌ **Low Trust:** International learners were unsure of the right path.

### Solution

We redesigned the experience with:

- Unified certification pathways.
- Guided dashboards and visual progress tracking.
- Embedded contextual support.
- Fully mobile-responsive design.

Methods:

- 18 interviews with diverse learner segments.
- Data analysis + NPS reviews.
