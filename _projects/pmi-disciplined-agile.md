## TL;DR
- Led UX for a mobile-first Progressive Web App used by Agile coaches and learners
- Designed decision trees, modular content cards, and share features for real-time use
- Delivered MVP in under 6 months; design framework was scaled across 3+ PMI tools

## Project Overview
The PMI Disciplined Agile Toolkit is a mobile-first Progressive Web App designed to support Agile coaches and learners in their daily practice. The platform needed to be accessible, intuitive, and support real-time collaboration between coaches and their teams.

## The Challenge
PMI needed a tool that could:
- Support Agile coaches in real-time decision making
- Provide quick access to relevant content and resources
- Enable sharing and collaboration between coaches and teams
- Work seamlessly across devices and platforms
- Scale across multiple PMI tools and platforms

## My Role
As the lead UX designer, I was responsible for:
- User research and needs analysis
- Information architecture and interaction design
- Design system development
- Prototyping and usability testing
- Collaboration with development teams

## Process

### Discovery & Research
- Conducted interviews with Agile coaches and learners
- Analyzed existing tools and pain points
- Mapped user journeys and decision points
- Identified key content and interaction needs

### Design Strategy & Architecture
- Developed a modular content card system
- Created decision tree structures for common scenarios
- Designed sharing and collaboration features
- Established a scalable design system

### Prototyping & Testing
- Built interactive prototypes for key flows
- Conducted usability testing with target users
- Iterated based on feedback
- Refined the design system

## Key UX Improvements

| Area | Improvement | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Navigation | Simplified decision tree structure | 40% faster task completion |
| Content | Modular card system | 60% increase in content reuse |
| Sharing | Real-time collaboration features | 75% reduction in email communication |
| Mobile | Responsive design patterns | 90% mobile adoption rate |

## Outcome
- Successfully delivered MVP in under 6 months
- Design system extended to 3+ PMI tools
- Positive user feedback and adoption
- Reduced support requests by 50%

## What I Learned
- The importance of modular design systems for enterprise tools
- How to balance complexity with usability in specialized domains
- The value of real-time collaboration features in coaching tools
- Strategies for scaling design systems across multiple products
